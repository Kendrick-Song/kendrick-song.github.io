# Part 7：多容器应用（Multi-container apps)

Up to this point, you’ve been working with single container apps. But, now you will add MySQL to the application stack. The following question often arises - “Where will MySQL run? Install it in the same container or run it separately?” In general, each container should do one thing and do it well. The following are a few reasons to run the container separately:

- There’s a good chance you’d have to scale APIs and front-ends differently than databases.
- Separate containers let you version and update versions in isolation.
- While you may use a container for the database locally, you may want to use a managed service for the database in production. You don’t want to ship your database engine with your app then.
- Running multiple processes will require a process manager (the container only starts one process), which adds complexity to container startup/shutdown.

And there are more reasons. So, like the following diagram, it’s best to run your app in multiple containers.
